# Bullet

DESCRIPTION
Here is a repository for "Bullet", an RPA software. We are building an easy to use RPA software that with only few steps allow users to automate basic data copy/pasting actions for lists of data.

The initial steps of this software is to have an interface that allows our clients to access their RPA bots easily, to add/remove robots, shedule their run time and choose what to do when robots stop running.

The next step is to have an automation capabiliti built in to the "Bullet" interface, where users could very quickly setup a few step robot that does up to 10 steps and then loops those steps for another iteration or another object. This functionality will eliminate tasks that are not mundane, but might take few hours to do every time you face such task.

USAGE
This is a private project, to use it, you must contact developing team, ask for a demo and for a setup.

FEATURES
- Storing your .exe .bat and other file type scripts/robots in a single interface, that allows you to controll those robots, shedule them easily and launch robots on startup.
- Up to 10 step cycle automation for unique manual labor task automation.
